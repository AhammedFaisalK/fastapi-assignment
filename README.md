Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AhammedFaisalK/fastapi-assignment.git
cd fastapi-assignment
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3. Install the dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up environment variables
In the root of the project, there is a .env.example file. You will need to create a .env file to store your MongoDB connection string and any other sensitive environment variables.

Copy the .env.example to create the .env file:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Open the .env file and add your MongoDB credentials:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
5. Run the FastAPI server
Use the run.py file to start the FastAPI server.

bash
Copy code
python run.py
6. Access the Swagger UI
Once the server is running, go to http://localhost:8000/docs to access the automatically generated Swagger documentation for the API.

7. Hosting the Application
Host the FastAPI project on a free hosting service like Koyeb, Heroku, or similar, and share the hosted Swagger URL.

Environment Variables
The .env file should contain sensitive information such as database connection strings. Make sure to exclude it from version control by ensuring it's listed in the .gitignore file.

Example .env file:

ini
Copy code
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> with your actual MongoDB credentials
